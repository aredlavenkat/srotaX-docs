# $asin

Computes inverse sine.

**Category:** Arithmetic · **Visual function entry:** Yes

## Signature (engine metadata)

Argument syntax: `SINGLE`. Minimum arguments: 1. Maximum: 1.

| Operand | Accepted types | Required | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| input | NUMBER | True | EXPRESSION |

Result types: DOUBLE.

## Null and missing (engine metadata)

- Null: With input set to literal null in the regression example: throws an exception. This is observed Fluxion behavior, not a general Mongo conformance claim.
- Missing: With input set to a missing direct-field reference in the regression example: throws an exception. This is observed Fluxion behavior, not a general Mongo conformance claim.

## Compatibility boundary

Classification: `MONGO_6_DIFFERENCES`. Verification scope reported by the engine: `ENGINE_REGRESSION_EXAMPLES`.

- Numeric results use Java double rather than Mongo BSON numeric promotion. Null handling, overflow and special values are not Mongo-certified.
- The one-element positional wrapper is not advertised.
- Verification covers the checked-in regression examples, not full BSON, null, error or collation equivalence.

These statements come from the engine catalog. This documentation has not independently certified equivalence against a running MongoDB server.

## Example coverage

No executable example for this operator is included in the documentation suite yet. Use the signature above and validate your complete expression; do not interpret registration as a guarantee for every argument combination.
