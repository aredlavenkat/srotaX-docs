# $literal

Returns a value without evaluating it.

**Category:** Types and conversion. **Studio Visual entry:** Not exposed. This page describes Core expression execution; Studio also checks field types and authoring permissions.

## Syntax and arguments

Supply one expression as the operator value.

| Argument | Metadata input types | Required | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | ANY | Yes | Literal configuration |

Argument count: minimum 1; maximum 1.

Declared result types: **ANY**. Actual result types for tested inputs appear below. Metadata is an authoring hint; where a case differs, use the observed result and treat the discrepancy as a limitation.

## Example

Expression:
```json
{
  "$literal": {
    "x": "$field"
  }
}
```

Input document:
```json
{}
```

**Observed SrotaX result:** {"x":"$field"}.

## Behavior for different inputs

Each table changes **only the indicated argument** from the example above. Other arguments retain their baseline values. Values normally come from the input field `probe`; literal configuration arguments are replaced directly. “Missing” means the field is absent, not explicitly null. Numeric strings are strings, not numbers.

### Argument: `input`

| Input case | Supplied value | SrotaX result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| null | null | null |
| zero | 0 | 0 (int32) |
| negative | -2 | -2 (int32) |
| decimal | 2.5 | 2.5 (double) |
| numeric string | "12" | "12" |
| text | "hello" | "hello" |
| empty string | "" | "" |
| boolean | true | true |
| false | false | false |
| typed date | null | {'$numberLong': '1768489200000'} (date) |
| decimal128 | null | 1.25 (decimal128) |
| empty array | [] | [] |
| numeric array | [1,2,3] | [1,2,3] |
| mixed array | [1,null,"x",3] | [1,null,"x",3] |
| nested array | [[1,2],[3]] | [[1,2],[3]] |
| empty object | null | {} |
| object | null | {"x":1} |
| ISO date string | "2026-01-15T15:00:00Z" | "2026-01-15T15:00:00Z" |

## Invalid invocation shapes

| Invocation | SrotaX result |
| --- | --- |
| {"$literal":[]} | [] |
| {"$literal":{"unexpected":1}} | {"unexpected":1} |

## Scope and reproducibility

This page records **21 executed cases**. It covers individual argument substitutions, not every cross-product of arguments, locale, daylight-saving transitions, numeric overflow, collation or resource limits. No untested behavior is guaranteed.

[Download exact expressions, inputs and SrotaX results](../../downloads/operator-behavior/literal.json). Errors are observed messages, not stable public error codes. The reference generator reads the checked-in execution report; do not edit generated observations by hand.

## MongoDB differences (removable section)

Compared with **MongoDB 9.0.4**: **21 exact BSON matches**, **0 both rejected**, **0 value/type/acceptance differences**, **0 object-field-order differences**.

“Exact” includes numeric BSON types and object key order. A value of `3` as int32 differs from `3.0` as double. Object-field-order differences are reported separately; object key ordering is not enforced by the engine regression baseline. Both rejected does not mean the error codes or messages match. This is finite-case evidence, not full compatibility certification.

No differences were observed in the compared cases.
